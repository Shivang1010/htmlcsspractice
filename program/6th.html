Maggi is an international brand of seasonings, instant soups, and noodles that originated in Switzerland in late 19th century. The Maggi company was acquired by Nestl√© in 1947.<br></br>
Maggi instant noodles are popular in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, and India. Nestle has 39% market share in Malaysia, where "Maggi" is synonymous with instant noodles, and had 90% market share in India prior to a nationwide ban by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. Following the ban, the market share was reduced to 53% in India. In Malaysia, fried noodles made from Maggi noodles are called Maggi goreng. Maggi Instant noodles are branded as "Maggi 2 Minute Noodles" in Australia and New Zealand.
<br></br>
In India, Maggi Masala noodles carry a green dot, meaning they are specifically formulated to serve vegetarians. However, Maggi chicken noodles carry a red dot, indicating that they are not vegetarian. This special formulation is not available in other countries, unless imported from India.
